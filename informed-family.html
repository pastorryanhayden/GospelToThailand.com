            <h1>We are the Hernandez family!</h1> 
            
            <p>I am Ahmet, the leader of this crazy clan. I married up when I married my incredible wife, Rachael. We have three precious children: A.J., Sarah, and Chi Chi. Actually, it is Rachel, but “Chi Chi” is what Sarah called her as a baby and it has stuck! Rachael and I were called to be missionaries in June of 2008. He used preaching, His Word, and many missionaries! It’s a great story of God moving in each of our hearts!</p>

            <p>We are both from Pensacola, but I served in the Navy for 5 years. We went from Charleston, SC, to Guam (10  miles long by 3 miles wide) and have called Louisiana home since 2007.  The Lord used Phillip and Lori Bassham to let us know our next place to call home will be Thailand!</p>

            <p>Each of our children has been saved. Praise the Lord! They are probably even more excited than we are to be able to serve the Lord!</p>

                    <h4>Ahmet</h4>
                    <p>I was born and raised in a Christian home, where I trusted Jesus as my Lord and Saviour before the age of 10. But as I grew older, I drifted away from my heavenly Father and wasted many years of my life on things of the world. When I left the Navy in January of 2007, I ended up in the town of Zachary, Louisiana where I began attending Grace Baptist Church. It was under the preaching and teaching of Brother Tom that my wife and I heard the Lord’s call to missions for our family in June 2008. Since then, we have been preparing for the work that God had called us to. In July 2011, God revealed to us that He wanted us to go to Thailand. Looking back at our lives, we can see how God has prepared us for the work He has called us to in Thailand!</p>

                    <h4>Rachael</h4>
                    <p>I do not ever remember a time when I did not believe in God. When I would ride my bike, I would look up in the clouds and imagine Jesus coming back. Only, He was on surf board. (I’m from Pensacola! What can I say!) However, it wasn’t until right after we got married that I trusted Jesus as my Lord and Saviour. Since then, I have been tested and tried and my faith has grown and grown.</p>
                    <p>While stationed in Guam, we attended a church started by missionaries and I used to think, “There is no way I could do that.” Well, in June of 2008, God called both my husband and me to a life beyond sitting in the pew. What a joy! He has been faithful to guide us each step of the way. </p>

                <img src="http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/1204229930_school.sign.jpg" alt="">
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>I graduated from Grace Baptist Bible Institute under the teaching of Pastor Tom Schreeder.</p>
                <p>I graduated from Baptist Bible Translator Institute (BBTI) in Bowie, Texas, under the teaching of Dr. Rex Cobb.</p>
                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>My family has been privileged to serve God at Grace Baptist Church Zachary for the past five years. While there, we have served in many different capacities, including: leading the bus route, children’s church, teaching different Sunday school classes, one on one personal discipleship, and many other areas. I have also spent the past two years as associate pastor and school administrator, which afforded me many opportunities to preach and teach the Word.</p>
                <p>I also served for five years in the United States Navy. I learned many interpersonal skills during my time as as an instructor and submariner. I also was exposed to many different and high stress level situations.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fa fa-book"></i> The Scriptures</h3>
                    <p>We believe that the Holy Bible (the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments) was written by men who were supernaturally inspired; that it is truth without any mixture of error and therefore is, and shall remain the only complete and to the end of the age, final revelation of the will of God. We believe that God has divinely preserved His Word in the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. II Timothy 3:16-17; II Peter 1:19-21; Psalm 19:7-11; Psalm 12:6-7; Psalm 119:140.</p>
