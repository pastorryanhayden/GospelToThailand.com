[{"Instructions":"This is a single row base. ","Content":"I am Ahmet, the leader of this crazy clan. I married up when I married my incredible wife, Rachael. We have three precious children: A.J., Sarah, and Chi Chi. Actually, it is Rachel, but “Chi Chi” is what Sarah called her as a baby and it has stuck! Rachael and I were called to be missionaries in June of 2008. He used preaching, His Word, and many missionaries! It’s a great story of God moving in each of our hearts!\n\nWe are both from Pensacola, but I served in the Navy for 5 years. We went from Charleston, SC, to Guam (10  miles long by 3 miles wide) and have called Louisiana home since 2007.  The Lord used Phillip and Lori Bassham to let us know our next place to call home will be Thailand!\n\nEach of our children has been saved. Praise the Lord! They are probably even more excited than we are to be able to serve the Lord!","Image":[{"id":"attrBwkGoWtA2cGVV","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/K2b9PXxbRBejSyHKT0VI_f9daf0968ee6d190fb6707a9d7253f1e.jpg","filename":"f9daf0968ee6d190fb6707a9d7253f1e.jpg","size":26615,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/H5oMaiPTLi0nVrB1DVXA_small_f9daf0968ee6d190fb6707a9d7253f1e.jpg","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/lOMMNtQRr6iGTwbZ9aDd_large_f9daf0968ee6d190fb6707a9d7253f1e.jpg","width":512,"height":400}}}],"Heading":"We are the Hernandez family!"}]
